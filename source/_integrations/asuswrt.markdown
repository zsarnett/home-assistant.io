The `asuswrt` integration is the main integration to connect to a [ASUSWRT](https://event.asus.com/2013/nw/ASUSWRT/) based router.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Presence Detection** - The ASUSWRT platform offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a ASUSWRT based router.
- **Sensor** - The ASUSWRT sensor platform allows you to get upload and download data from your ASUSWRT within Home Assistant.

## Configuration

To use an ASUSWRT router in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
asuswrt:
  host: YOUR_ROUTER_IP
  username: YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: "The IP address of your router, e.g., `192.168.1.1`."
  required: true
  type: string
username:
  description: "The username of a user with administrative privileges, usually `admin`."
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: "The password for your given admin account (use this if no SSH key is given)."
  required: false
  type: string
protocol:
  description: "The protocol (`ssh` or `telnet`) to use."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: ssh
port:
  description: SSH port to use.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 22
mode:
  description: "The operating mode of the router (`router` or `ap`)."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: router
ssh_key:
  description: The path to your SSH private key file associated with your given admin account (instead of password).
  required: false
  type: string
require_ip:
  description: If the router is in access point mode.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
interface:
  description: "The interface of the router that you want statistics from (e.g. eth0,eth1 etc)"
  required: false
  type: string
  default: eth0
dnsmasq:
  description: "The location of the dnsmasq.leases files"
  required: false
  type: string
  default: /var/lib/misc 
sensors:
  description: List of enabled sensors
  required: false
  type: list
  keys:
    "upload":
      description: TX upload sensor
    "download":
      description: RX download sensor
    "download_speed":
      description: download mbit/s sensor
    "upload_speed":
      description: upload mbit/s sensor
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note warning'>

You need to enable telnet on your router if you choose to use `protocol: telnet`.

</div>

### Example Sensor Configuration

To enable ASUSWRT sensors as part of your installation, reference the following example configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
asuswrt:
  host: YOUR_ROUTER_IP
  username: YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME
  ssh_key: /config/id_rsa
  sensors:
    - upload
    - download
    - upload_speed
    - download_speed
```

The example above, creates the following sensors:

- sensor.asuswrt_download (unit_of_measurement: Gigabyte - *Daily accumulation*)
- sensor.asuswrt_download_speed (unit_of_measurement: Mbit/s)
- sensor.asuswrt_upload (unit_of_measurement: Gigabyte - *Daily accumulation*)
- sensor.asuswrt_upload_speed (unit_of_measurement: Mbit/s)


## Padavan custom firmware (The rt-n56u project)

The [rt-n56u project](https://bitbucket.org/padavan/rt-n56u) does not store `dnsmasq.leases` which is used to track devices at `/var/lib/misc/` as `asuswrt` do. However this integration can still be used for the rt-n56u project by changing the dnsmasq location using the `dnsmasq` variable to `dnsmasq: '/tmp'`
Also, to get the statistics for the `WAN` port, specify `interface: 'eth3'` as this is the interface used in the rt-n56u project
