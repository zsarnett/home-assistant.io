Detect people in camera images using [Sighthound Cloud](https://www.sighthound.com/products/cloud). The Sighthound Developer tier (free for non-commercial use) allows 5000 images to be processed per month. If you need more processing per month you will need to sign up for a production account (i.e., a Basic or Pro account).

This integration adds an image processing entity where the state of the entity is the number of people detected in an image. For each person detected, an `sighthound.person_detected` event is fired. The event data includes the entity_id of the image processing entity firing the event, and the bounding box around the detected person. 

If `save_file_folder` is configured, on each new detection of a person, an annotated image with the name `sighthound_{camera_name}_latest.jpg` is saved in the configured folder if it doesn't already exist, and overwritten if it does exist. The saved image shows the bounding box around detected people and can be displayed on the Home Assistant front end using a [Local File](/integrations/local_file/) camera, and used in notifications.

**Note** that by default the component will not automatically scan images, but requires you to call the `image_processing.scan` service, e.g., using an automation triggered by motion.

## Configuration
